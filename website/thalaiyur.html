       <p> Also known as Rat Tail Falls, Thalaiyar Falls is located in the lush green slopes of Palani Hill ranges in the Dindigul District, in Kodaikanal. With a height of 297m, it is the highest waterfall in Tamil Nadu, the sixth highest waterfall in India. There is a view tower in the park at the Dum Dum Rock, from where you can get a beautiful view of the falls and the Manjalar Dam. There is a hiking route near the waterfall.</p>


       
       <p> The river water coming to the falls is from Perumal Malai village, through a 9 km downstream and is said to be clear. On the contrary, it may be polluted, and hence, visitors to the area are advised to avoid drinking it.</p>


        
        <p>>On a bright day, the falls is visible from the Dum Dum Rock viewpoint on the Batalugundu-Kodaikanal Ghat Road; where it appears like a white long and narrow strip of water on a background of the black rock cliff face. According to legends, Lord Muruga used to visit this rock on his way to the Palani Hills.</p>
