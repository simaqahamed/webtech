       <p>Situated in the 'Princess of Hill stations', Kodaikanal, the Pillar Rocks have become a lovely picnic spot. Constituting a beautiful mini garden; the place is named so as it has three vertically positioned boulders reaching up to a height of 400 feet. The aura here is full of affection and is evidence of a great love story. The 'white cross' which once existed on these rocks represented David Gell's excellent tribute to love. The view of rocks is not something to be missed. They stand as an untouched miracle for the tourists visiting Kodaikanal.</p>

       <p> The pillars are famous for providing bird's view of nearby surroundings. The chambers between these two massive rocks are called the Devil's Kitchen. Fewer times you might find rocks covered with mist and clouds, but when the ways become clear nothing beautiful than this could be ever seen. Jutting straight away from the hills that surround them, the pillar rocks are majestic. You can come here, sit and relax as you soothe your eyes over the high hill ranges and clear skies. Moreover, do not forget taste the potato and onion bhaji which is served outside the mini garden.</p>
