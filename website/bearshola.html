       <p> Located at a mere distance of 2 kilometres from the Kodaikanal Lake, the Bear Shola Falls is a popular picnic spot in the region. This cascade is a seasonal attraction that comes to life in its fullest during the monsoons. An interesting legend behind the unique name of this place is that it was a favourite haunt of a bear who used to frequent this water body to drink water, hence imparting it the name Bear Shola Falls.</p>

        <p> With dense forests coupled with the chirping of birds, Bear Shola Falls is a little heaven. Also, the forest area of the Western Ghats situated near the falls is a biodiversity hotspot where you can have a rendezvous with animals like monkeys and deer in the wild.</p>
        
        <p>The terrain around the Bear Shola Falls is slanting and uninterrupted by commercialisation, which makes it the perfect destination to go on a trekking adventure. As you approach the falls, you will encounter the hill path where you can reach by means of a motored vehicle. From there on, a concrete path leads the way to a short trek of around a kilometre which runs deep in the woods.</p>
